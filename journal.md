The video game that i love to plaay is grand theft auto, the reason why I say that grand theft auto is a game I love to play is because Grand theft auto is an open world game that can let you play many different games and be with many people. Gtahas also been very global over the years and yet till this day they still tend to be global and their games can survive for years because of how much it gives off to a player playing the game for fun.

1.  The precision of a measurement says nothing about whether the measurements are grouped about the correct value
2.   can directly impact patients, including their quality of clinical care. Incorrect diagnostic codes, for example, may prompt clinical professionals to inadvertently provide the wrong services or even withhold essential medications
3.   Developing good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey is crucial because it directly impacts the quality of your code, making it more reliable, maintainable, and less prone to errors, which can save significant time and effort down the line, especially when working on complex projects; essentially, small details can have big consequences in software development, so being meticulous from the start is key to producing high-quality

One process in my life that is like computer science is my daily routine when ever i do my skin care and take a shower, the reason why i say this is because when ever i startv my skin care i start with something i have to take specifically. Just like how in computer science how a code is told to do something and grab something specifically, and computer science impacts my life by how in a daily use everyday people like me use stuff like tv and videogames and even electrical fridges amd stoves. My day to day would be different without technology by how, without technology we wouldnt have tvs and transportation nor online communication, and without them we would still be living in the stone ages looking at rocks and riding horses

Job Title: lawyer

Job Description: The main responsibilities of being a lawyer is how the lawyer has to get their client out of crimes situations that they say they never committed 

Skills Required: java scrpt, the reason why I say this is because java script has a main thing that makes their Character or anything in the code makes them say what they need to say during court

Education and Experience: you need a bachelors degree and experienced knowledge of being a lawyer

Career Growth: opportunites for growth would be how in law you first work for free to see if you can handle the job and they teach you what to do when a client comes in with a case

Reflection: This job interests me in computer science too because in law there are many cases where the client has used technology in their case to do certain things in order to catch how he is innocent

helpful: Ai improves the health care insdustries by how ai  can do deep research into the health industries by its self, its technology is like asking a person to research something and it can be found in sec

harmful: The Ai can also make it very stupid for a human to use because they can take advantage of the Ai instead of research purposes
since theyll only want an answer.

computer science plays a huge role in the elections by how many people vote and how many numbers go up in the voting score and the biggest impact from the election would be how many polotics would affect the election and the voters that come with it. And by how the elsections are with kamala and trump, but with both sides saying some non important things, the computer voting score from the people are abrubtly unsure on who to vote on since both sides are bad.

1. it is important to protect your personal information when publishing online because if someone gets your personal information they can either steal your information or hack your account.

2. well steps i take arem 1 dont post personal information, 2 dont make obvious things that say too much about you, and 3 dont give out your personal data

3. i have never shared any information online because i was never really influenced into doing so and if i could reflect on that now id still never give out personal information like that to no one.

4.  by working in a save environment that is not in a sketchy website which is preventing from your personal information to be put out.

# november 12, 2024

1. the event that has been selected would be the presidential election with trump and kamala, because i choose this event is that during the election they would have stations for election votes that had their names written on them to see who voted for who, as in phython there would be a certain amount of numbers to be counted in during the score of maybe a video game or of a program.

2. The reason why technologye can address this role is because during the elections people also watch what the presidents have to say on tv and how people watch as what they say.

Technology has changed the way we grow and purchase our foods because of how nowadays we have cars that transport food and transport other goods to our houses. The reason why i say this is because the way we all live around based on technology is through apps that have been developed for the way of life for example doordash, grubhub, hubby, and home improvement. Its not like how it was back then, because back then they used horses to deliever things and cups for telephones, more in general they used their minds in their times, but now we have a phone that has available to everything in need of us. To the effects of technology, there are also no negative effects towards it. The reason why i say this is because the way technology is around us, they help us with anything in need for our home or for ourselves including other chores needed to do.

1. What excites or concerns you about this technology?

What mainly excites me about technology is how technology is the main way all of us live by, we use technology in cases of if we are cocerned or if we are in cases of danger.

2.  Can you think of an innovative way this technology could be used in your field of interest?

  technology could be used in  my feild of interest by the art design it makes. The reason why i say this is because many technology stuff have to deal with drawing and ai doing  and making art out of things too. 

4. What ethical considerations might need to be addressed as this technology evolves?

the ethnical consideratons would be that this technology may evolve to have a mind of its own, amd the reason why I say this is because of how nowadays we have our own robots and have transporting cars and ai that do things by their own will.

1.  the term brain rot had a negative effect on me with social media by how this term is used so much that it even made me wonder on about our place and future up to now and then.

2.  the terms lore and slop have made me experience 2024 with a disgust feeling because these terms are mainly used stupidly to make people laugh but it really is only that little kids laugh at.

3.  it is a meaningful to engage in technology because technology helps more with your developemnt in your brain including code which can help you forget about brainrot and become better.

 Yes, I am looking forward to winter break. 

 # january 8, 2025

 1. looking back:
    
    what i did last semester was i completed all my work and focused really hard on everything that i had to do for my teachers and hung out with my favorite people and what could be improved is how i can focus more harder and have no distractions whatsoever.

    2. looking ahead:

  The main thing i would love to learn on and work on is how people can develope such technology from back then and how it was ussed to create nowadays technology.

  3. certifications:

  I am interested in a tech certification because it would help indourse intp technology in college and help my gpa rise and get into the college that i would love to get into. And what would help me reach that goal is by working more harder and focusing more in the work.

  # january 13, 2025 

  I would prepare myself into working more by doing alot for my industry and do a job that everyone needs rthe most and that would be makimg robots.The reason why I say this is because by making more robots can make more money and more things for people to use with these robots and it would help the economy more by how these robots can be usee for certain tasks other than AI doing everything.

  # january 23, 2025

  The goverenment iompacts on technology use by wanting to take away technology from  the people because thier community gets ruined because of that. The communities can continue operating globally by how tiktok can be protected by the world if they keep their app running for the people, and one feature and policy i would consent to doing is by making tiktok a more reliable sourced used for school and for more logical and historical information.  This situation can apply to my own projects by not letting people steal my ideas and let them address their own.

Computers prevent collisions by the satelite of an object in the locator being known by the object. But many such as helicopters and planes werent improved for airspace collisons to not occure, the only possible solution to prevent this tragic event from happening is to make more satellites on flying objets become more noticable. The reason why I say this is because with satellites being on flying objects, this can prevent any other person from flying into the wrong zone and make any flying object noticable from a birds eye view.

# february 18, 2025

The most interesting thing i have learned last week is how society is built on nowadyas, the reason why I lsarned this is because of how our new president has banned every person from our state and made only people born in the state allowed in, this would cause a huge collision to many ofther stars which will make such an impact and out break to our society.

1. The technologies that I use are an. iphone an ipad and a console, thesee phones are used everyday to use transportation and destinations wnd even play games at home. For example, i use an iphone to go on trips because on iphones they have a gps and it tracks your steps on how far you are from your desination. Thsse technologies connect to what we learn in class by how in class we use computers to find information and vocab words to learn and to study for school just as much as how a phone is used for information as well.

bans are somethung that isnt beneficaial on students at all,  the reason why I say this is that many students have the mentality to change the ways abd find new ways to do things even thiugh its banned. And these policies influnece only students to break more rules and to cause chaos to the teachers, it also creates a world  for them to invent more ideas to hide things and make things worse for the teacher and the school in general. If these actions were to have been implemented in my school i would fond it supporive but yet negative for the school, because no matter what students will always find ways to do what ever is banned but even worse and id say they should do their best to create peace for the school and take out all the bad students out of the school becauee of tjeir attitude that can influence others.
